### 2.2 Experimental Dataset
## Dataset setup
For all the datasets, be sure to read and follow their license agreements, and cite them accordingly. The datasets we used are as follows:

- [NTU RGB+D 60](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02808.pdf)
- [NTU RGB+D 120](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04757.pdf)


## Data Availability
The datasets used or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The raw dataset was downloaded from the dataset home page https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/actionRecognition/.There are 302 samples of **NTU RGB+D 60** and 532 samples of **NTU RGB+D 120** need to be ignored, which are shown in the **'src/reader/ntu_ignore.txt'**.
