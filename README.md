# Dataset
The datasets we used are as follows:
- [NTU RGB+D 60](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02808.pdf)
- [NTU RGB+D 120](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04757.pdf)

The raw dataset was downloaded from the dataset home page https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/actionRecognition/.

There are 302 samples of **NTU RGB+D 60** and 532 samples of **NTU RGB+D 120** need to be ignored.Ref [link](https://github.com/shahroudy/NTURGB-D/blob/master/Matlab/NTU_RGBD_samples_with_missing_skeletons.txt).
